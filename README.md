# lab-experiment-on-SIFCON
in this module the various lab experiments performed for determining the characteristic strength of the SIFCON concrete such as compressive strength 
flexural strength, split tensile strength at normal atmospheric temperature and at elevated temperature are conducted. 
based on the tests the performance of the SIFCON can be evaluated.
